# RankGun Ranking Centre

This is the rankgun ranking centre which is designed to interact with the RankGun API, made using roblox-ts and react-lua.

The RankGun ranking centre allows people to pay for a gamepass in exchange for a role in your group.

Please keep in mind this software is available for everyone under the [RankGun PolyForm Shield License](/license.md).

## How to use

The centre itself is a self-contained ModuleScript, compiled with roblox-ts and loaded with a Script like as below:

```
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local AssetService = game:GetService("AssetService")
local moduleModel = AssetService:LoadAssetAsync(77678073057230)
moduleModel.Sandboxed = false

local moduleInstance = moduleModel:FindFirstChild("MainModule")
moduleInstance.Name = "rankgun-ranking-centre"
moduleInstance.Parent = ReplicatedStorage

local RankgunModule = require(moduleInstance)
RankgunModule.Init({
    workspaceId = "<workspace-id>",
    apiToken = "<api-token>",
    -- verbose = true, -- optional; logs API requests/responses to the server console for debugging
})
```

> [!TIP]
> As a RankGun customer, use the loader scripts available for download in your [Workspace](https://www.rankgun.works/workspace/), which will pre-fill the necessary details and automatically update.

Before using, you must enable a few Experience Settings - namely, Security -> Allow HTTP Requests and Allow Loading Third Party Assets. You may also wish to enable DataStores in Studio to allow for playtesting.

## Telemetry

So that RankGun can support self-hosted centres, the centre reports lightweight, aggregate
operational telemetry to RankGun's API (`/api/telemetry`) using the same API key it already
uses for ranking. This lets RankGun see whether a centre is online, what build it's running,
how rank redemptions are converting, and where API calls are failing.

It sends only instance-level facts (centre version, place/universe/server id, environment,
current player count, uptime) and a small set of events: `centre_boot`, `heartbeat`,
`ranks_loaded`, `rank_redeem_attempt`, `gamepass_not_owned`, `rank_result`, and `api_error`
(HTTP status + short error code only).

**No end-user data is ever collected** — no UserIds, usernames, or raw error bodies. All
requests are best-effort and run on a background thread, so telemetry never affects gameplay.
See `src/server/telemetry.ts`.

## Development

The client's GUI is rendered with react-lua components; it replicates using a LocalScript parented to the PlayerGui. We use Remo for remote declaration and to allow for full types.

To build the module, run `npm run build` after ensuring all dependencies are installed.
